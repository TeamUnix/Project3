 			 elements are: solar-panels, hydrogen storrage, battery-charger, windturbine
 			 converter, userinterface, the electric grid and different loads such as a
 			 hyrogen engine, vacumcleaner etc. }

\subsection{Storry Telling}
Aarhus University, a place full of innovation and great ideas. Jan Nielsen
welcomes a class of high-school students to the green system simulator. Here it
is possible to see how much energy you can get out of green energy harvesting
such as wind and solar energy. When the system produces to much energy, the 
energy is stored in form of Hydrogen. The Hydrogen is to be used for a Hydrogen
driven engine which is placed nearby the green system simulator. Here people can
really come an get an idea about how much they can help the environment, but
also their own wallet, if they invest in some green energy for their own house.
The guests can navigate around on a screen to see how much energy each device 
creates or consumes, this is shown in a down to earth way, where everybody can follow, 
even persons without no special education or courses in the energy field.

\subsection{System Definition}
\textbf{Proposal 1:}\\	
When devices is connected to the Energy HUB, it automatically sees if is a input
or an output device.
