			\subsubsection{Block Diagram: Candidates in the system}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Power Switch:} Part of the hub that turns on and off power to its modules.
				\item \textbf{Consumers} Modules that consumes power (e.g. light, washing machine, electric car)
				\item \textbf{Producers:} Modules that delivers energy to the hub (e.g. Wind-turbine, photovoltaic-cells)
				\item \textbf{Storage:} Modules that both consumes when the system over produces and "produces" (gives energy to the consumers) 
				when needed (e.g. battery, air compressor). 
				\item \textbf{Grid:} The grid is used to start up the whole system. It is also used if producing modules does not produce 
				enough energy to the consumers.
				\item \textbf{Current Sensor:} Unit that measures the current taken from the grid. To calculate the amount of green energy produced.
				\item \textbf{Temperature:} Unit that measures the temperature where the system is placed. If the temperature is too high or 
				low it might damage the hardware.
				\item \textbf{Humidity:} Unit that measures the humidity where the system is places. If the humidity is too high the 
				hardware might be damaged.
				\item \textbf{Ethernet:} Unit that has connection to an internet database.

			\subsubsection{State Machine Diagrams}
				\textbf{ }\\
				\textbf{Description of the different states: }
				\\ After the initialization of all modules connected to the hub, the system is in  \textit{Idle Mode}.
				\\\textbf{Idle: } After initialization the hub goes into idle mode. The hub stays in idle mode until a start signal is given from the user (from the web or the physical hub 							interface). 
				\\\textbf{Run mode: }The system stays in Run Mode until an event happens, e.g. temperature or humidity reaches their limits,
				a new module is connected, a module should be removed, the system is over-/underproducing, the log should be updated etc.
				\\\textbf{Standby: }If the system overproduces (produces more energy than there is users for), it will standby some of the energy-producing modules.
				\\\textbf{Start: }Whenever a new module is connected it waits for the user to start the module, either by using a start button on the hub or from the web interface.
				\\\textbf{Stop: }To securely disconnect a module, the user must use the disconnect button (on the module or from web interface) to make sure all data is saved.
				\\\textbf{Shut down: }If the system finds itself in a critical condition (temperature, humidity, communication problems) it shutdown it's connected modules,
							        tries to save all available data to the log. Then it sends an message (in form of e-mail) to the user, describing the problem, and the module
							        powers off itself. 
				\\\textbf{Connect module: } The system checks if it has seen exactly that module before, if that is the case it updates variables from the database
									(uptime, production etc.). If the module is new for the system, it creates it in the database and gives it an unique id.
				\\\textbf{Warning: }Is sent if the system tries to set a submodule in standby- , start- or stop mode, but after a while it has not changed (timeout). 
							    After the timeout state, the system returns to run state.

		\textbf{The Hub diode states}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Green: }The modules is in Run mode, no problems detected.
			\item \textbf{Yellow: }The module is powered on, but the user has not requested a startup of the module.
							The yellow diode also light up if the user stops the system.
			\item \textbf{Red: }An error has occurred in the system.
		\end{itemize}
		If the hub is in the init state and the button is pushed, the green button will light up when the system has settles. If an error occurs the red one will light up.
		When the hub is in Run mode and the button is pressed the hub powers down all the submodules where after it powers down it self.
		\textbf{Submodules state}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Green: }Constant light, the module is in Run mode, no problems detected. Flashing light, the module is in standby mode, set by the hub
							due to over-/underproduction or other.
			\item \textbf{Yellow: }Constant light, the module is plugged to the hub, but the user has not requested a startup yet or the module has been stopped.
							During initialization (a startup has been requested) the diode flashes.
			\item \textbf{Red: }An error has occurred with the connected module.
		\end{itemize}
		When a submodule is in init mode and the button is pressed, the yellow diode starts flashing (indicating that the system is initializing and trying to start the submodule), whereafter
		the green diode will light up if the submodule has started up. If an error has occurred the red diode will light up. 
		When the submodule is in Run mode and the button is pressed it will power off the module and only light up the yellow diode (indicating initial state).
		The web-interface. In the little comic book user interaction with the system is shown.

		The energy systems webpage is open for everyone. Everyone can go to the webpage and see the status of the system and all of its sub-devices.
		When the user logs onto the system he gets access to start and stop devices, read the log files, change settings such as, warning mail address,
		password e.g.

	\subsection{Function Analysis}
		From an analytic perspective, functions are very useful as they are intended to elaborate the objective of the system. When defining functions the question is, \textit{what is the system supposed to do?} In the usage part, it was concerned \textit{how} the system should be used. This makes the usage and functions closely connected, since it is difficult to talk about how a system is being used without discussing what it should do.\\\\
		When analyzing functions the object is to get a complete list of all the functions the system must implement. The goal is not to describe every single function in detail, quite the contrary the goal is to identify the functions.\\\\
		Functions can be grouped into types. There are four different types of functions:\\\\
		\textit{Update} is a type defining functions which are activated by a problem or application domain event, and which results in a change in the model's state.\\\\
		The type \textit{Signal} defines a function which is triggered by a change in the model's state. Running the function always results in a reaction to its surroundings: that is either the reaction is a display to the actors in the problem domain or else the reacting a direct intervention in the problem domain.\\\\
		When an actor has need for information the function of type \textit{Read} is activated. The function is displaying the relevant data of the model to the actor.\\\\
		Finally, the \textit{Calculating} function is activated when an actor provides information, which should be included in a computation which also involves data from the model. The function returns its computed result to a display.\\\\
		When all functions are found they must be defined by their type and complexity, as below.

					\hline
					Issue & Critical & Very Important & Important & Less Important & Notes \\ \hline
					Safe					& X & ~ & ~ & ~ & 1 \\ \hline

					\end{tabular}
				\end{table}
			Notes:
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item The safety is a very important factor, as the system is meant as a showoff system for high-school students, who should
			be able to be near the system without hurting themselves or the system.
			\item The performance in the system is not critical when considering it from the users perspective. It doesn't matter if it takes a few seconds before the system responds the user.
			But the system should still be able to react fast in order not to harm it self, but also to get a high effectiveness. 
			\item The system should be easy to use. All kinds of people should be able to use the system without any specific training.
			Connecting of new devices and doing administrative jobs on the system a small walk through of the system is required. 
			\item Errors must not occur in the system. The hub is the central nerve in the whole system, therefore if the hub does not run, non of the subsystems does and no energy is routed.
			\item The user of the system should be able to find eventual errors on the system by him self, with help from a good error log created by the system.
			\item The only thing possible to maintain remotely is start and stop of submodules + power down the whole system, which is less important as the system is placed locally.
			\item Only one kind of the system is to be produces, but still the price should be kept at a relatively low level (as we have an undefined maximum price of the system).
