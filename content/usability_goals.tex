\section{Interaction Design}
\subsection{Usability Goals}
The below sections will be given points on a scale from 1 to 10, depending on
the importance (10 is very important and 1 is not important)
\begin{itemize}
	\item 10 safe to use (safety)
	\item 8 easy to learn (learnability) 
	\item 8 easy to remember how to use (memorability)
	\item 6 effective to use (effectiveness) 
	\item 5 efficient to use (efficiency/performance)
	\item 3 have good utility (utility)	
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Safety}
The safety is a very importanc factor, as the system is meant to placed outside
where some people might come by. Also the system is meant as a showoff system
for high-school students without any technically experience who might be
interrested in touching with everything possible.
\subsubsection{Learnability}
Should be easy to learn how to use, because\ldots
\subsubsection{Memoriability}
The system is build for Jan Nielsen who will probably only use the system when
people comes by and wants to see the system.
\subsubsection{Effectiveness}
The effectiveness of the system is not that important because\ldots
\subsubsection{Efficiency/Performance}
The efficiency of the system is not that important because\ldots
\subsubsection{Utility}
Not that important as it should be as simple as possible a system.
\subsection{User experience goals}
Down below the user experience goals are listed in nummeric order:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Entertaining
	\item Motivating
	\item Satisfying
	\item Fun
	\item Enjoyable
	\item Helpful
	\item Aesthetically pleasing
	\item Supportive or creativity rewarding
	\item Emotionally fulfilling
	\item more?
\end{enumerate}
Something about why the list about looks like it does.

This picture is taken direktly from the book, the caption too . Should it be
there ?
