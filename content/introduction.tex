\chapter{Introduction}
	This project is about development of an energy hub, as the main part of a complete green energy system. 
	\\
	Energy harvested from the nature (Producers) is splitted  for devices that need energy (Consumers or Storage modules).
	\\
	Our teams role in this project is to develop the controlling unit (energy hub), that includes the device that take some energy input from the harvester units and sends some energy output to different devices.
