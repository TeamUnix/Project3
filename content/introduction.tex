\chapter{Introduction}
This report contains information about the different development phases used to create an energy hub being part of the renewable energy system, which has been the task in Pro3 \& Pro4. In the project, tools given in the classes during the first and second year of the EDE (Electronic Design Engineer) education have been used to create the energy hub. The report is written in a chronologic way, where the first chapter describes the goal of the project and what it should all end up with (pre project). The next step is listing requirement, creating overall pictures of the system, defining protocols and the design of the system (launch phase). The creation of the product will then be described in time boxes, where a part of the system will be described in a time box. If something has changed in a part of the system, it is described in a later time box (after a time box has finished the section is locked and changed has been written in a following time box).
The final stage of the project is handing over the product to the customer.
	

%old intro:
%This project is about development of an energy hub, as the main part of a complete green energy system. Energy %harvested from the nature (Producers) is splitted for devices that need energy (Consumers or Storage modules).
%Our teams role in this project is to develop the controlling unit (energy hub), that includes the device that take some energy %input from the harvester units and sends some energy output to different devices.
