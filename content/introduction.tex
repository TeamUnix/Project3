\chapter{Introduction}
This report contains information about the different development phases used to create an energy hub being part of the renewable energy system, which has been the task in Pro3 \& Pro4. Tools given in classes during the first and second year of the EDE (Electronic Design Engineer) education, were used to create the energy hub. 

The report is written in a chronologic manner, the first chapter describes the goal of the project and what would be the final product (pre project). 

The next phase of the project development is listing requirement, creating overall pictures of the system, defining protocols and the design of the system (launch phase). 

The creation of the product is described in time boxes, where different parts of the system will be described in a different time boxes. If something has changed in a part of the system, it is described in a later time box (after a time box has finished the section is locked and changed has been written in a following time box).
The final stage of the project is handing over the product to the customer.
	

%old intro:
%This project is about development of an energy hub, as the main part of a complete green energy system. Energy %harvested from the nature (Producers) is splitted for devices that need energy (Consumers or Storage modules).
%Our teams role in this project is to develop the controlling unit (energy hub), that includes the device that take some energy %input from the harvester units and sends some energy output to different devices.
