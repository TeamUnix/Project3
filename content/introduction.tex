\chapter{Introduction}

This report contains informations about the initial stages in developing an energy hub. The hub is part of the Renewable Energy System which is the project during the PRO3 and PRO4 courses. In the PRO3 course the Pre-project have been written, defining the rough edges of the system, followed by the Launch Phase which contains a detailed description of how the system should be realised. 
\p The whole system around the energy-hub consists of producing, consuming and storage devices where the hub is the central device in the system. The main function of the hub is to communicate with the different modules and route the energy from the producers to the consumers.
\p The Pre-project and the Launch Phase have been created following the standards of the EUDP-method, which is a description of how to develop small IT-systems\footnote{http://eudp.net/index.php/Main\_Page}. The EUDP method is used to define the hardware interface as well as the software guidelines.
