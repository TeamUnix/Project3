\textbf{Story Card 2:} When the energy production is higher (batteries full
charged, and no loads connected), the energy should be stored as hydrogen in a safe way so
later it can be converted again to energy by a fuel cell, used as gas for a
hydrogen car or generator.\\
\newline
\textbf{Story Card 3:} In order to show of, the interface has too be userfriendly
and easy too use, so students coming over to AU - Herning without any energy
knowledge should be able to easily navigate the system.\\
\newline
\textbf{Story Card 4:} The system will be in a outside environment, so it as to
be robust against weather conditions and people temper.\\
\newline
\textbf{Story Card 5:} When batteries and hydrogen tanks are fully charged, the
energy should be provided into the national power grid or/and university electrical
system.\\
\newline
\textbf{Story Card 6:} For further improvements and development the system have
to be fully documented, scalable and modular hardware construction.\\
